1. Import the libraries.
2. Split your data set into the train and test and print their dimensions.
3. Plot the train and test datasets.
4. Compute the error evaluation. If linear regression: average of mean squared error
5. Run test cases against the error function.
6. Create and fit the model using linear regression in sklearn library
7. Compute the error on training data set
8. Compute the error on test data set.
9. Compare those errors, print them to see the actual values. ,You can use 0.2f to reduce the decimals.
10. Plot predictions over data range
11. Find the optimal degree by selecting a max degree and for each degree, construct the error functions as arrays.
12. Compute the optimal degree by getting argmin of error_cv set. You can use numpy to do this.
13. Plot the result. You can use "plt_optimal_degree" plotting function.
14. Perform fine regularization. Idea is regularization the parameter lambda.
15. Plot the result.
