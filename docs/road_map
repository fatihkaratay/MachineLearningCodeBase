1. Import the libraries.
2. Split your data set into the train and test and print their dimensions.
3. Plot the train and test datasets.
4. Compute the error evaluation. If linear regression: average of mean squared error
5. Run test cases against the error function.
6. Create and fit the model using linear regression in sklearn library
7. Compute the error on training data set
8. Compute the error on test data set.
9. Compare those errors, print them to see the actual values. ,You can use 0.2f to reduce the decimals.
10. Plot predictions over data range
